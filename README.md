# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction-Using-Hybrid-Deep-Neural-Networks
The project titled "Air Quality Index Prediction Using Hybrid Deep Neural Networks" focuses on forecasting future Air Quality Index (AQI) levels by analyzing the past 10 years of environmental data. The system leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series analysis to capture temporal dependencies, and integrates Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for categorizing AQI into five distinct levels ranging from ‘Safest’ to ‘Dangerous.’ The hybrid model enhances prediction accuracy and provides early warnings for air quality concerns. Developed using Python in Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab, the project utilizes tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, model training, and result visualization. This solution contributes to proactive environmental monitoring and public health risk assessment.
